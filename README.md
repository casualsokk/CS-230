# CS-230
Over the course of this class we have been working with The Gaming Room to aid in designing their game, Draw It or Lose It. The premise 
of their game was that two opposing teams have 30 seconds to correctly guess what they are being shown a picture of, and if they fail to 
guess at the end of the 30 seconds, the other team gets to guess. While the premise of the game is fairly simple, the actual design of it
was not. One aspect of the design process that I felt particularly good about was understanding how the UML diagram related to the actual
code. When I first looked at the code and the UML diagram, they were extremely confusing, but once I realized how they related to each other
it all fell into place. Once I understood how the UML diagram related to the code, I was able to see the bigger picture and that really helped
with keeping in mind the various design constraints I found along the way. While most of the other parts of the design document were fairly
simple, the recommendations are what I struggled with the most. The sheer amount of choices that are out there when it comes to server
architecture, operating systems, or programming languages, and how they all relate to each other, was staggering. I found it hard to find the 
time to devote to actually researching which one would be the absolute best for this type of game. While doing research for the design document,
the actual document itself was incredibly useful for keeping the needs of the user in mind, because if you alienate your users why even bother 
getting their input at all? All in all, it was only a slightly painful experience to design this game. I attempted (and failed) to manage my time
wisely, which resulted in almost all of my assignments being late. In the real world, there is a very good possibility that this would have resulted
in my firing from the company that I worked for. In the future I plan to set reminders and specific blocks of time aside to give the users needs
and design of their game the time that it requires.
